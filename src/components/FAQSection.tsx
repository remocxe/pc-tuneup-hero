      question: "Do I need to back up my files before service?",

      question: "How long does each service take?",

    },
    {
      question: "What if my computer can't be fixed?",
      answer: "If your computer is beyond economical repair, I'll give you an honest assessment and may offer to buy it for parts. You'll never pay for unsuccessful repair attempts."
